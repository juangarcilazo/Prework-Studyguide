    <li> Enter your Git Section notes here:</li>
    <ul><li>Git section refers to both Github and Gitlab which is something we constantly want to be using as a devlopper because it allows us to fix bugs in our code faster and more effeciently by going to the last version of the code that wasnt bugged up.</li>
      <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
      <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>  
      <li>git checkout main: returns you to your main branch</li>
      <li>Remember that it's important to frequently sync the local version of your code with the remote version in GitHub. This matters, especially when working on a team, so that a functional, updated version of the project can be shared and accessed by all team members. Working on an outdated or stale version can lead to big sync problems. That's why it is best practice to resolve and iterate on smaller changes, rather than wait for an accumulation of many small and large changes, which could complicate conflict resolution and debugging.</li>
